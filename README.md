# Brain Tumor Auto Segmentation for Magnetic Resonance Imaging
<img src="images/prediction.png" width="30%">


This project uses the U-Net CNN to ingest 3-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and automatically segment tumorous regions of the brain by classifying each voxel as either background, edema, non-enhancing tumor, or enhancing tumor.







 
*NOTE 1: AN OLDER VERSION OF TENSORFLOW/KERAS WAS USED DURING THIS COURSE.*
I am currectly re-implementing this project in PyTorch as refactoring the code to the most current stable version of TensorFlow would essentially require rebuilding the entire project anyway.
