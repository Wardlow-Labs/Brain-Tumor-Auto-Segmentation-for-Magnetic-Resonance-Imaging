# Brain Tumor Auto Segmentation for Magnetic Resonance Imaging
 
*NOTE 1: AN OLDER VERSION OF TENSORFLOW/KERAS WAS USED DURING THIS COURSE.*
I am currectly re-implementing this project in PyTorch as refactoring the code to the most current stable version of TensorFlow would essentially require rebuilding the entire project anyway.
